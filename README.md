## 🔌 API
AniePick uses the **[Jikan API](https://jikan.moe/)** for anime data, which fetches from MyAnimeList:
- **Anime details:** Title, synopsis, genres, release date, rating, poster.
- **Search filters:** Query by genre, score, year, and type.

## 🚀 How It Works
1. The app loads anime data from the API based on your filter settings.
2. A random anime is selected from the results.
3. Once viewed, it’s removed from the pool for that session.
4. Click **Next** to get your next surprise anime.
